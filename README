# Python clickstack plugin

This is a very simple Python plugin, mainly used for testing.

It supports running a Python module with a list of arguments.

It currently only copies *.py files from the project root -- it does not
support packages or other directories. This can be enhanced as needed.

Sample metadata config:

    "python": {
	"app_module": "simple.py",
	"app_args": "$app_port $app_dir/s3"
    }
